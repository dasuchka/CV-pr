    <h2>ABOUT MYSELF</h2>
    <p>My name is Dasiukevich Anastasiya, I'm a graduate of the Belarusian state university (BSU) of the Physics faculty. 
        And also i'm a graduate of the Joint Institute of BSU and Dalian University of Technology (DUT). 
        Despite the fact that my specialization is different, I have always been fond of programming. 
        I studied Python, HTML/CSS/JS, SQL, 
        these languages are used in different spheres: in HTML/CSS/JS i've created simple sites and web-apps, 
        in Python simple apps with library Tkinter and games with Pygame,
        but i think the most interesthing for me is data analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think i have a good level of English, as i stydied in China, and now i have some of english speaking students. 
        I'm very positive, purposeful, responsible sociable person who can learn fast. I like think and ask questions.
        Ready to study new and work hard to achieve goals. I will be glad to work in a young energetic team.
